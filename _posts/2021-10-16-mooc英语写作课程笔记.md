英语写作慕课笔记




## 副词的误用

then, therefore, thus, hence等是副词，不能直接连接两个分句，需要加上and。不过需要注意的是，thus经常做副词用分词短语作状语。eg: 。。。 thus obaining U.

## 名词的误用

名词不能修饰名词，需要用形容词。

eg:

environmental quality
mathematical calculation
experimental results
theoretical analysis

## 介词连词的混淆误用

Since作为介词，意义是“自从”，没有“由于”的含义。

because后如果是名词短语，应该加上of。

Due to是介词，不能连接句子。

## 形容词误用

修饰动词需要用副词，不能用形容词。

哪怕是合成词，修饰动词的还是需要用副词形式，比如fully+...

修饰形容词的应该是副词。

## 搭配的误用

很多是固定搭配，比如quick meal， 不能是fast meal。

### 介词和名词的搭配错误

the voltage on the resistor (wrong)
the voltage across this resistor (right)

Voltage is measured with volts(F)
Voltage is measured in volts(T)

英语中用in而不是towards搭配direction。

method表示方法应该用by而不是of来表示XXX的方法。

表示比较的话，应该用the advantage of A over B。

常见的比较用法：
the advantage of A over B
A is more than B
The superiority of A to B

provide sb with sth , or provide sth for sb.

same as 和similar to 的搭配容易混淆。


### 动词名词搭配错误

应该避免中文中的一些搭配习惯错误。比如improve the speed and quality就是不对的，应该increase the speed。

realize一般主语是人，主语是方法时应该用achieve.

speed不能用fast/slow，应该是high/low。

修饰对象如果是物品而不是price，则应该用cheap/expensive。

### 如何避免搭配错误

1. 写作时应该查搭配词典，而不是汉英词典。www.freecollocation.com
2. 在线英语语料库.
3. 建立自己的专属语料库。filelocator pro。


## 句法问题

### 时态误用

一般使用一般现在时和一般过去时。
介绍文章用一般现在时。如果为了说明已经完成的研究，可以使用一般过去时。
在描述图表信息时应该用一般现在时。
说明试验结果时，应该用一般现在时。

### 语态误用

不应该过量的使用被动语态。
如果不用提及生产者，发起者等，可以考虑使用被动语态。
被动语态连接should,must等表示强制。

### 悬垂结构

悬垂分词作状语，主语如果不是句子的逻辑主语，则是一种错误。

避免悬垂结构，分词或者不定时做状语一定要保证主语是一致的。

如果修饰对象是人，如果可以让句子更简洁，且不会影响句子的理解，也可以不一致。但需要谨慎。

### 流水句式

英语的流水句式是错误的，应该用逗号加连词，或用分号，或者直接写成不同的句子，或者重新组织句子。

## 课上的杂记

当句子有代词时，名词在主句用，代词用于从句。
Before it can work, a computer must be told what to do.

一些名词加上ly就成了形容词，一些形容词加上ly就成了副词。

如果不同维度的形容词修饰同一个名词，可以放在一起而不用任何连词，如果同一个维度的则中间加一个and。
big red apple      crispy and sweet apples 这里crispy和sweet都是说口感的
如果可能会引起歧义，那多个形容词可以用逗号分隔，同时修饰后边的名词。
如果其中一个形容词是给另一个形容词服务的，中间可以用连字符连接。

同位语可以代表前一句话 AC can be changed into DC, a process known as rectification.
如果没有逗号的，一般都是修饰前边的核心名词，但是加上逗号就不一定了。

A of B that takes.... 这里有of表示B是修饰A的，那么后边的that从句也是修饰A的。

which从句在翻译中如果没搞明白可以通通翻译成“这是。。。”。

记住，从句一般是修饰名词的，应找到其具体修饰哪个名词。

插入语，一般是副词或者介词短语，比如for example, however, generally speaking等，基本没啥重要的意思,放在开头、结尾或中间，用逗号隔开，即使去掉句子也是完整的。

用的句型：
句子，but 句子。
句子。However,句子。
but是连接词，但是however是副词，没有能力连接两个句子（用逗号，thus一样）。

如果是一些俗语，可能会引起歧义，但是大家都这样说。
All the glitters are not gold.

时态：未完成 to do ,正在做doing，已完成done。时间点就是ing（或不加表示一种事实），时间段就是have /has/had/will have -ed.

> 近些年他们一直在研究一种新的半导体材料。近些年是时间段，所以是have -ed.在时间内正在做，所以doing。所以是have been doing的形式。

## 句子表达的简洁性

### 名词话结构代替从句

名词化结构可以代替从句，使得句子表达更简洁。
eg：Since the internet was **invented**, ....  =  Since the **invention** of the internet, ...

这种用法在论文写作中替代“we...."的时候很有用。

### 分词短语，独立主格，with结构替代从句

#### 分词短语替代从句：
The electrons can move freely in the crystal structure, which makes it have high electrical conductivity.
改写成: The electrons can move freely in the crystal structure, contributing to its high electrical conductivity.
英美人使用从句不多，但多使用分词构成的简单句。

The system is described and this is followed by a discussion of the safety analysis methodology.
改写成: The safety system is described, followed by a discussion of the safty analysis methodology.

#### 独立主格结构

The training network contains 8 feature extraction blocks, and each feature extraction block contains 3 extraction layers
改写：The training networks contains 8 feature extraction blocks, each **containing** 3 extraction layers.

#### with结构替代从句

The trains of A and B are 1700 meters apart. = with the trains being 1700 meters apart.

### 介词短语替代从句

Because it has ... 改成 Due to its ... because of ... owing to ...

还有就是省略定语从句的which is...，将从句改成介词结构。

### 其他方法

使用代词简化句子表达。

如果涉及到常数，可以考虑使用括号来简化句子的表达。例如：The sample was then placed into a temperature-constant (30oc) and humidity-constant (85%) box.

The accuracy of the improved model is 93.2%, higher than that of the VGG-16 network model(90.5%).

还可以使用固定短语简化句子表达。

## 衔接和连贯

### 衔接理论

1. 在情景上是连贯的，由此表现出语域的一致性。
2. 在语篇本体上是连贯的，所以是衔接的。

## 主动被动

由什么构成 —— consist of
构成了什么 comprise constitute compose make up
This figure _____ two triangles.
这个图由XXX构成，其实里边有被动的含义，所以后边的四个词都需要用被动。而consist of本身就有被动含义，所以直接用就可以。

This paper makes an analysis of the research results that they obtained by a new method deifferent from traditional ones.
被动: A detailed analysis is made of the research results that they obtained by a new method different from traditional ones.
这种句式比较好，如果用results作为被动句的主语，会让句子的结构不清晰。

为了表示高达……等类似的概念，我们采用as tall as 的句式。

## 改写the more , the more句式

The more pressure from the Western powers, the more powerful we will eventually become.
1.找到比较结构的词，变成比较结构
If there is more presssure from the western powers, we will eventually become more powerful.
2.比较结构放到句首
The more presssure... , the more powerful....
3.剩下的东西按顺序挪下来
The more pressure there is from the Western powers, the more powerful we will eventually become.
4.去掉there is等系动词,变成原句子。

## 非谓语动词

to do 表示动作没有发生
doing 表示动作已经做了或者正在做
你走的时候记得锁门 Remember to lock the door when you leave.
你记得锁门了吗？ Do you remember locking the door ?

the signals to be processed 待处理的新号
the processed signal 已被处理的信号

反射不定式：假如一个句子可以用it is ... to do sth，那么就应该不用被动，比如the question is difficult to answer.  === it is difficult to answer this question.

英语里的乘除法都是XXX等于XX被X相乘除。如：Voltage equals current multiplied by resistance.

## 某些课堂的记录

动名词是可以做主语的，Playing the piano is her hobby.

动名词还可以做宾语。 如：Like doing sth.

Remember to do 未发生  Remember doing 表示这个动作已经发生，类似的还有stop to do & stop doing.

作定语时，一般ed分词表示别动的意思，相反则是用ing形式。

从句有六种：定语从句、状语从句、同位语从句、宾语从句、主语从句、表语从句，其中后三种都叫做名词性从句。

同位语从句起解释的作用，相当于等号，冒号，破折号。

主语从句一般以it开头，然后接上that, 可以把that后作为主语来替代it.

Because 里边有强因果关系，而since是弱因果关系，比如你来了我们一起吃个饭吧，

## 虚拟语气

 I suggest that he (should) quit smoking.
 If he had taken part in that meeting, he would have met Professor Smith.
 If there were no COVID19, we would have an offline exam.
 非真实条件
 方法：时态退一格
 He took part in that meeting.
 He had taken part in that meeting. (比如上边第二句话)
 There is no COVID-19.
 There were no COVID-19. （参见上边第三句话）

He will quit smoking.(他的意愿)
He shall quit smoking.(我的意愿)

## 强调

It is ... that/who/which ...

He ate a sandwich for lunch at school.
如果需要强调主语，则是It is he who ate a sanwich for lunch at school.
如果需要强调school,则是It is school taht he ate a sandwich for lunch.
如果是需要强调动词，则一般用助动词do ,did, does进行强调，情调后接动词原形。

## 倒装

### 全倒装

Shown in Fig.1 is a block diagram of a radio transmitter.
这句话是主语比较长，所以为了便于理解，将主语放在后边。英语一般要求头轻尾重。

### 部分倒装

Only when queue 0 is empty will the system execute processes in queue1.
Only带一个条件开头的时候就一定要倒装。

否定词开头也需要倒装。Not never nether nor hardly rarely等，但是如果No承担形容词的功能则不是。

Not only does computer congtrol greatly increase the speed of measurement, it can increase the accuracy as well.

## 省略

计算机科学的教学与研究
the teaching of (这里省略了后边的computer science)and research on computer science
这里需要注意的是，我们只能省略一样的部分，但是介词如果不一样，则介词不能省略。

## 摘要

1. 背景：建立中心议题，概括论题内容，回顾前期成果，之初研究差距，继承前期研究；
2. 引言：之初研究目的，陈述当前研究，提出研究问题，假设；
3. 方法：研究材料设备装置，介绍研究方法，描述研究步骤；
4. 结果：陈述发现，结果观点；
5. 结论：得出结论，解释并讨论结果，评价和比较，指出应用价值和启示。
